        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Ukrainian cuisine is known for its delicious tastes, traditional
          cooking technologies and generous ways to serve guests. It is an
          important part of the country’s culture and lifestyle. Yonderbound’s
          global ranking put Ukraine among the 20 best countries in the world
          for food. Ukrainian dishes are known for their variety and high taste
          qualities. Some Ukrainian dishes have a centuries-old history, for
          example, borscht, salo, varenyky.<br />
          Ukrainian cuisine heavily influenced by the rich dark soil (chernozem)
          from which its ingredients come and often involves many components.<br />
          The cuisine emphasizes the importance of wheat in particular, and
          grain in general, as the country is often referred to as the
          "breadbasket of Europe". The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from
          ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye,
          as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and
          beetroots. Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic
          techniques as well as other European techniques, a byproduct of years
          of foreign jurisdiction and influence.<br />
          Here is a list of must try food in Ukraine that any foreigner should
          try to taste.

          other ingredients like minced meat, pork cracklings, fried onions, and
          spices before being wrapped in the cabbage leaves. Depending on the
          season, cabbage leaves can be replaced with fresh beetroot leaves or
          young grape leaves. They can be made into different sizes and shapes
          and stewed in a variety of sauces and broths.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Salo refers to cured slabs of pork fatback. Salo is typically prepared
          by curing slabs of fat in salt and different spices and herbs like
          paprika, bay leaves, garlic, coriander, and black peppercorns. In some
          areas, it can also be smoked and aged. Salo can be eaten raw or cooked
          (salted, boiled, smoked, fried) and makes a great accompaniment to rye
          bread and horilka. So, not much to say here, except that salo is a
          famous dish of traditional Ukrainian cuisine and Ukrainians love their
          Salo, not only for its unique taste but also for the health benefits
          it brings. Pork fat is high in vitamin D and A, which helps with brain

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          This silky Ukrainian corn porridge is not only a widely enjoyed dish
          across Ukraine, but it is also an essential part of the traditional
          cuisine of our nation. Originating in the Carpathian mountains, Banosh
          was once linked with the Hutsul minority, with males being assigned to
          make the meal. That is what they call a thick porridge made of corn
          flour and boiled in cream or sour cream. It is always sprinkled with
          brynza (a type of sheep milk cheese) and roasted bacon. Mushrooms are
          also often added to the porridge, to make the taste even richer. The
          Hutsuls say that real banosh should only be cooked in a cauldron on an
          open fire and you can stir it only with a wooden ladle.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Ukrainian horseradish is popular in two forms. First, it is a fresh
          plant that is grated and sprinkled over slices of meat and boiled eggs
          to add a special taste. Second, it is a main ingredient in the
          horseradish and beetroot salad, which is regarded as a sauce and
          consumed with all kinds of dishes: meat, kholodets, salo, etc.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          For Ukrainians, it is the central dish served at all celebrations.
          Holodets is made of meat broth, frozen to a jelly-like state, with
          pieces of meat inside. The dish’s name comes from the Ukrainian word
          holodnyii, which means “cold”. One of the main components for this
          kind of aspic is pork leg. To be more specific, the lowest part, the
          one that ends with hoofs.

        <h2 class="title" data-reveal="left">Zelenyj Borscht</h2>
        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Zelenyj borscht translates to “green borscht” and refers to a type of
          sour-tasting Ukrainian soup made from leafy vegetables. Sorrel is most
          commonly used though it can be made with other vegetables as well like
          spinach, chard, nettle, and orache. Like beet-based borscht, zelenyj
          borscht is based on a meat or vegetable broth and typically served
          with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. It’s usually garnished with
          dill and served with sour cream.

        <h2 class="title" data-reveal="left">Halushky</h2>
        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Halushky are small pieces of dough, round or rectangular, cooked in
          water or milk. A feature that sets them apart from varenyky is the
          absence of any filling. However, before serving, they are generously
          sprinkled with grilled pieces of lard or onion, or they are just added
          to soup. In Poltava, locals continued the tradition of perpetuating
          their favorite dish in stone - that is how a monument in the form of a
          huge plate with seventeen dumplings appeared.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Deruny is the Ukrainian version of a potato pancake. First, the
          potatoes are grated into a homogenous mass. Then, the egg, flour,
          salt, and pepper are added to the mix, and the resulting mixture is
          fried in vegetable oil. Deruny in Ukraine are quite thin and crispy.
          Depending on the cook, other ingredients like ground meat, cabbage,
          and mushrooms may be added but sour cream accented with dill is a
          common accompaniment.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Syrnyky is a traditional Ukranian dessert/breakfast dish that is made
          of soft home cheese, eggs, and some flour, then fried. More often than
          not people add raisins and vanilla extract. Syrnyky is supposed to be
          crispy outside and creamy inside. After being gently fried in a pan,
          syrniki is topped with jam and sour cream. It literally melts in the
          mouth and will fast become your favorite dish.

        <h2 class="title" data-reveal="left">Pampushky</h2>
        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Pampushky is the epitome of garlic bread! With a soft pillowy texture
          and flavorful garlic toppings. These lovely yeasted buns from Ukraine
          come in both sweet and savory varieties. The sweet form is frequently
          loaded with jam, berries, cottage cheese, and fresh fruit, while the
          savory variant is usually seasoned with garlic sauce and eaten with
          Borscht (Ukrainian beet soup). German colonists may have been the ones
          who brought Pampushky to Ukraine. These delicious buns became a
          popular national dish at the end of the 19th century, eventually
          gaining “status” as a typical Ukrainian dish.

        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          The Ukrainians use cornflour, butter, salt, and water to make this
          dish. Once ready to eat, it will be sliced with a knife and served
          with Bryndza cheese, bacon, pork rinds, or mushrooms. This delicacy
          has several names. In the central area, it’s known as Mamalyga, but
          the Carpathians people call it Kulesha. Despite the name difference in
          different regions, the recipe for this Ukrainian corn meal mush
          remains the same.

        <h2 class="title" data-reveal="left">Kapusniak</h2>
        <p class="text" data-reveal="left">
          Kapusniak is one of the oldest and significant dishes in Ukraine. It
          used to be prepared for weddings, funerals, and Christmas dinners.
          Nowadays, Ukrainians enjoy this soup or even in a form of porridge
          (called "zasypana kapusta", literally - filled up cabbage) throughout
          the year. The key ingredient of kapusniak is sauerkraut, which is
          thoroughly washed before cooking to give the soup its transparent
          color. It is cooked in meat or mushroom broth with potatoes, onions,
          carrots, and bay leaves. Traditionally kapusniak is served with sour
          cream and chopped parsley. If you are preparing "zasypana kapusta",
          after the cabbage has been steamed, it is covered with millet and
          seasoned with melted lard. This is another unforgettable national
          dish, which combines the taste of stewed cabbage with the taste of
          fried pieces of lard ("shkvarky").
