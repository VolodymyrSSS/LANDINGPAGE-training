      <section class="article-text">
        <p class="drop-cap">Few artists have permeated popular culture as thoroughly as Andy Warhol. More than three decades after his death, his vision continues to inform how we understand celebrity, consumer culture, and the very notion of what constitutes art. While his silk-screened Marilyns and Campbell's soup cans have become visual shorthand for Pop Art, Warhol's true legacy lies in his radical reconceptualization of the artist's role in society.</p>
        <p>Born Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh to working-class immigrants, Warhol's journey from commercial illustrator to art world superstar embodied the American dream, even as his work offered subtle critiques of consumerism and celebrity worship. His famous proclamation that "in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes" proved remarkably prescient in our age of viral fame and social media influencers.</p>
        <p>While critics initially dismissed his appropriation of commercial imagery as superficial, Warhol's deadpan embrace of mass culture concealed more complex intentions. "I want to be a machine," he once stated, yet his work reveals a deep fascination with human desire, mortality, and the mechanisms of fame.</p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote">
          <p>"Art is what you can get away with."</p>
          <cite class="quote-attribution">— Andy Warhol</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Perhaps most revolutionary was Warhol's understanding of the artist as brand. Through his silver-wigged persona, deadpan interviews, and entrepreneurial ventures like Interview magazine, he crafted a public image as carefully as any of his silkscreens. This approach anticipated today's boundary-blurring between art, commerce, and personal branding.</p>
        <p>His studio, famously dubbed "The Factory," functioned simultaneously as production facility, social club, and performance space. Through this innovative model, Warhol challenged the romantic notion of the solitary artist, instead embracing collaboration and mechanical reproduction. The Factory became home to a revolving cast of collaborators—from socialites to street people—all participants in what might be considered Warhol's greatest creation: his scene.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Beyond the Silkscreen</h3>
          <p>While his silkscreened images remain his most recognizable work, Warhol's experimentation extended far beyond this technique. His pioneering films like "Empire" (1964)—an eight-hour static shot of the Empire State Building—challenged conventional notions of narrative and viewership in ways that anticipated both structural film and social media's celebration of the mundane.</p>
          <p>His work with The Velvet Underground demonstrated his understanding that cultural influence could extend beyond traditional artistic boundaries. By bringing together experimental music, performance art, and multimedia presentation, these collaborations helped establish the template for interdisciplinary art that dominates contemporary practice.</p>

          <h3>The Business of Being Warhol</h3>
          <p>Perhaps most prescient was Warhol's understanding of the increasingly blurred boundaries between art and commerce. While previous generations of artists had sought to position themselves outside market considerations, Warhol openly embraced the commercial aspects of artmaking, accepting portrait commissions from wealthy clients and declaring, "Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art."</p>
